Kakapo, also called an owl parrot, is a species of large, flightless, nocturnal,
ground-dwelling parrot endemic to New Zealand. It has finely blotched yellow-green plumage, 
a distinct facial disc of sensory, vibrissa-like feathers, a large grey beak, short legs, large
feet, and wings and a tail of relatively short length. It is the world's only flightless parrot,
it is also possibly one of the world's longest-living birds (in life-span). 
It is critically endangered.
