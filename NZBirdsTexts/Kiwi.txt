Kiwis are flightless birds native to New Zealand. At around the size of a domestic chicken, 
kiwi are by far the smallest living ratites (which also consist of ostriches, emus, rheas, 
and cassowaries), and lay the largest egg in relation to their body size of any species
of bird in the world. The kiwi is a national symbol of New Zealand, and the association is 
so strong that the term Kiwi is used internationally as the colloquial demonym for New Zealanders.
They are critically endangered.
