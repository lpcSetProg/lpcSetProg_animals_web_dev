The kea is an unusual parrot. It is the only truly alpine parrot in the world, and gained 
early notoriety among settler farmers for attacks on their sheep. Innately curious, kea 
are attracted to people wherever they enter its mountain domain, and are a feature at South 
Island ski-fields and mountain huts. Their attraction to people and their paraphernalia is a 
two-edged sword, providing both new threats and new opportunities.
