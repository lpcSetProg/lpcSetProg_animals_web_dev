Tui are a boisterous, medium-sized, common and widespread bird endemic to New Zealand. 
At first glance the bird appears completely black except for a small tuft of white feathers at its 
neck and a small white wing patch. Male tui can be extremely aggressive, chasing all other birds 
(large and small) from their territory with loud flapping and sounds akin to rude human speech. 
Birds will often erect their body feathers in order to appear larger in an attempt to intimidate a rival.
