The takahe is a sedentary and flightless bird currently found in alpine 
grasslands habitats. Although it is indigenous to swamps, humans have 
turned its swampland habitats into farmland, and the takahe was forced
to move upland into the grasslands. It is territorial and remains in 
the grassland until the arrival of snow, when it descends to the forest or scrub. 
It eats grass, shoots, and insects, but predominantly leaves of Chionochloa tussocks.
It was originally thought to be extinct, however, it was rediscovered in 1948.
