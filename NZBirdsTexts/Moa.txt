Moa were large, flightless birds that lived in New Zealand until about 
500 years ago. Moa was the tallest bird on earth, with the top of its' 
back 6 feet above the ground.  Moa were dominant herbivores in an environment 
dominated by birds. Moa were hunted to extinction by Māori, who found them easy
targets. Fourteen species of moa were hunted to extinction over a period of 100 
years during the 13th and 14th centuries, immediately after the first human 
settlement of New Zealand.
